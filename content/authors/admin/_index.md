I am an informal pre-doc at the Institute for Cogntive Neuroscience at HSE University.
Currently, I am running an MEG project studying syntax processing and a mousetracking project studying processing of negated sentences.
In my spare time, I am involved in several other mini-projects: a study on the role of phonemes in speech perception, development of a tutorial and a Python package to analyze frequency-tagging data, unsupervised classification of MEG data from the BIOMAG 2021 competition [Ketamine in Depression](https://www.biomag2020.org/awards/data-analysis-competitions/)).
Simultaneously, I am trying to educate myself about other areas of cognitive science which should eventually lead to finding or creating a PhD-worth project.
I do my current best to work with computational reproducibility and openness in mind. 
Here and there I make small contributions to scientific open-source projects.
