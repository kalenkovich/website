subtitle: ''
summary: 'This study will test the role of the phoneme-sized segments (phonemes/allophones) in speech perception.
Previous studies with similar aim never properly disassociated the influence of such segments from the auditory properties of the stimuli and the syllable identity simultaneously.
This study will do exactly that.
Phase 1 of this RR received revise and resubmit and then reject at [QJEP](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/qjp).
