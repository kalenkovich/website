title: 'Slow and Fast Responses: Two Mechanisms of Trial Outcome Processing Revealed
  by EEG Oscillations'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'This is an EEG study on cognitive control.
The ERSPs were compared between slower and faster correct and mistaken responses in order to look for the relationship between RTs, attention, and uncertainty.
My role was mainly to help the main investigator with implementing the analyses in MATLAB.'
